## Motivation

Even if multiple tools like this one already exists, such as the excellent [Symfony Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html#webpack-encore), I wanted to build my own version of this to serve as a foundation of my future projects to improve all my projects at once when I push some improvements on this tool.
